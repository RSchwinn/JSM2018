## We are Mandated by Congress
  
- to research
    - the contributions,
    - status,
    - and needs of small businesses and
- to serve as 
    - an independent voice for small business within the federal government, and 
    - the watchdog for the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA)


---
## What is the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR)?
  
- The CFR contains the final rules and regulations published in the Federal Register by the executive departments and agencies of the federal government.
    - e.g. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates civil aviation to promote safety.
    - e.g. The Food and Drug Administration (FAA) is responsible for protecting the public health by ensuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, and medical devices; and by ensuring the safety of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation.

---
## CFR

- Navigation of the CFR is difficult 
    - for the general public 
    - AND FOR AGENCIES.

- In 1970, the CFR was about 50,000 pages and required a little more than a year to read.
- Today, it is 180,000+ pages and requires almost 4 years to read.

## Executive Orders &amp; Statutes Requiring Review

1. [Presidential Executive Order on Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs (EO 13771)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/30/presidential-executive-order-reducing-regulation-and-controlling) requires that,
    - "[For] every new regulation issued, at least two prior regulations are to be identified for elimination..."

2. [Section 6 of Executive Order 13563](https://www.accesspro.org/programs/symposium/2012/FOIARegulationsBunk.pdf) requires agencies
    - conduct periodic, retrospective review and analysis of existing regulations that "may be outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively burdensome, and to modify, streamline, expand, or repeal them... so as to make the agency’s regulatory program more effective and less burdensome in achieving regulatory objectives."

3. Numerous statutes require agencies to review their rules, such as Title 5, Section 610, which requires:
    - Agencies review all rules promulgated within the previous 10 years

## CFR Organization (i.e. the real technical challenge)
Each of the 49 CFR Titles is (pseudo) organized by

- Volume
    - Subtitle
        - Chapter
            - Subchapter
                - Part
                    - Subpart
                        - Subject
                            - Section

&lt;!-- - Volume --&gt;
&lt;!--     - Subtitle --&gt;
&lt;!--         - Chapter --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Subchapter --&gt;
&lt;!--     - Part --&gt;
&lt;!--         - Subchapter --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Part --&gt;
&lt;!--     - Subpart --&gt;
&lt;!--         - Subject --&gt;
&lt;!-- - Section --&gt;


Although, all levels of nesting are optional. Actual tree may be organized as

- Title
    - Part
        - Section

## How to Explore and Analyze the CFR?

Use

- Natural language processing 
- Dynamic visualizations
- Auto-CFR aggregator
- Integrate uploads and copy and pasted text, such as
    - small business proposals/plans
    - proposed regulations
    - popular media/transcripts

## Before We Get Started: A Primer on Text Analysis Visualizations

Text analysis involves preprocessing, classification, clustering, information extraction, and visualization.

1. After assembling a corpus, the first step to remove stop words (and, the, of) and other words that convey little topic distinctivity (such as *therefore*, *next*, *however*, etc.).
2. The next step is to stem the vocabulary, i.e. trim them to their roots so that words with the same root are combined (fight, fights, fought).
3. The third step is to create n-grams, which are sets of words that co-occur improbably
often, and thus denote a single idea (White House, Supreme Court, etc.).

*See Olga Scrivner, David Banks, Julia Silge, and Simone Teufel for great introductory material.

## Importance 
Importance is measured by the `\(\theta\)` or `\(tf*idf\)`. Suppose you are interested in CFR entries related to the word *prescription*:

--
- `\(tf_{i,j}\)` measures the number of times term `\(i\)` appears in document `\(j\)`. e.g. `\(tf_{prescription,4}=10\)` means that the word *prescription* appears  in document `\(4\)` on 10 occasions.

--
- `\(df_i\)` measures the percent of documents within which the word *i* appears across the entire corpus (i.e. all documents) of `\(N\)` documents. e.g. `\(df_{prescription} = 0.25\)` means that the term *prescription* appears in 25% of the documents.

--
- `\(idf_i = \frac{1}{df}\)` is the inverse document frequency. By inverting the percentage, weight is added to words that appear infrequently. e.g. `\(df_{i} = 0.25\)` means that the `\(tf\)` is weighted by 4.On the other hand, if `\(df_i = 1\)`, and the term appears in all documents, the `\(tf\)` is weighted by 1.

--
- `\(\theta_{i,j} = \frac{tf_{i,j}}{df_i}\)` provides measure of the importance of a word in characterizing a given document within a corpus. e.g. `\(\theta_{prescription,4} = 40\)`.
--


Notice that if a word appears in every document, such as *the*, then the `\(idf\)` term does little to increase its relative importance. On the other hand, if the term appears in only a small percent of documents, then it's importance is magnified.


---
## Zipf’s Law
  
- Zipf’s Law says that the i^th^ most frequent term in a given language, or set, has a frequency proportional to `\(\frac{1}{i}\)`.
--
- If the most frequent term *the* occurs 100 times, then the second most frequent term *of* should appear 50 times, and, the third most frequent, *and*, should appear 25 times, etc.
--
- The rule supposedly applies to
    - Notes in musical performances
    - Frequency of access to web pages
    - Income distributions among top earning 3% individuals
    - Korean family names
    - Size of earth quakes
    - Word senses per word
--
- While the law doesn't seem to hold very well for many English texts, it works quite well for regulatory texts.

## Demo

## Demo
1. Explore 
    - Force vector maps and collapsible trees reveal structure and accentuate the interconnections between rules
2. Preperation
    - Solving the problem of granularity with automated aggregator
3. Analysis
    - Summarization algorithms provide succinct k-sentence summaries of any granularity of CFR content ranging from paragraphs to volumes [https://www.positive.news](https://www.positive.news)
    - Users can upload, copy &amp; paste, or provide links to their own content, such as business plans or proposed rules, to identify related CFR entries
4. Related Work 
    - Collaboration with the OIRA / NIST on IBRs
    - Collaboration with NIST and ITC programs on TBT

## Other Updates

- Parallel processing is straight forward and basic tests show that it already promises a 7-fold speed improvement.
- GPU processing could realistically increase processing speeds 1000-fold+ although it is much more difficult to implement.

---
## Demo Style 2

- *Sally the Rule Writer* is tasked with reviewing Title 1, Part 457.^[Volume 1, Chapter 4...]  She would like to search for related rules promulgated by other agencies.^[Names borrowed from W. Liberante.]
- *Ralph the Researcher* is labor economist who would like to search the IRS code for information on the treatment of earnings of workers with and without dependents.
- *Contessa the Small Business Owner* would like to identify the CFR sections most related to the topics found in her business plan.
